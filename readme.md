## Summary

This project focuses on the use of **Predictive Policing Software**, specifically **PredPol**, as a case study. The task involves selecting a relevant topic associated with the case study (e.g., bias, fairness, explainability, accountability) and creating a technical tutorial on that topic. The goal is to explore academic papers, articles, and reports to deepen the understanding of the topic and its connection to **PredPol**. The project can include various approaches, such as:

1. Conducting a comprehensive analysis on a real-world dataset relevant to the topic of predictive policing.
2. Reproducing techniques described in a research paper and validating the results.
3. Proposing and implementing new algorithms or machine learning approaches in the context of predictive policing.
4. Testing and comparing different packages or tools related to the topic.

The project includes a hands-on, reproducible tutorial. The final deliverables consist of:

- A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) that guides the user step-by-step through the tutorial, including installation requirements (e.g., Python version, necessary packages and versions). The tutorial should be reproducible and presentable.
- The notebook should include a clear and concise storyline, code snippets, results (such as charts), and a brief discussion of the key findings.
- The final report should offer further details about the dataset, tools, methodology, and/or proposed approach, with an in-depth discussion of the results where applicable.


## Dataset: Communities and Crime

The dataset used in this project was extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about crime rates in various communities across the United States and is available at the following link:

[Communities and Crime - UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/183/communities+and+crime)

This dataset includes data on various social, economic, and demographic factors, as well as crime rates in the communities, with the goal of analyzing potential correlations between these variables.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Conda Environment**  
   Ensure you have [Conda](https://conda.io/) installed. If not, install it from the [official website](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html). Once Conda is installed, create a new environment with Python 3.9 using the following command:

   ```bash
   conda create -n env python=3.9
2. **Activate the environment**
    ```bash
    conda activate env
3. **Install Required Packages**
    The necessary packages and dependencies for the project are listed in the first code cell of the Jupyter notebook. Please ensure you run that cell to install all required packages.
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
